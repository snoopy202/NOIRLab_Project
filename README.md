Identifying Doppelgänger Active Galactic Nuclei Across Redshifts

Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are among the most luminous objects in the universe, making them
valuable probes for studying galaxy evolution. However, understanding how AGN properties evolve
over cosmic time remains a fundamental challenge. This study investigates whether AGNs at low red-
shift (nearby) can serve as proxies for their high-redshift (distant) counterparts by identifying spectral
“doppelg¨angers”, AGNs with remarkably similar emission line properties despite being separated by
vast cosmic distances. We analyze key spectral features of bona fide AGNs using the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey’s Data Release 16, including continuum and emission lines: Nitrogen (N V), Carbon (C
IV), Magnesium (Mg II), Hydrogen-beta (Hβ), and Iron (Fe II - optical and UV) emission lines. We
incorporated properties such as equivalent width, velocity dispersion in the form of full width at half
maximum (FWHM), and continuum luminosities (1350˚A, 3000˚A, and 5100˚A) closest to these promi-
nent lines. Our initial findings suggest the existence of multiple AGNs with highly similar spectra,
hinting at the possibility that local AGNs may indeed share intrinsic properties with high-redshift
ones. We showcase here one of the better candidate pairs of AGNs resulting from our analyses.
